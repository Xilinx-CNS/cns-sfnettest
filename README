SfNetTest
=========

 sfnettest is a suite of tools for measuring network performance developed
 by Solarflare.  It differs from existing tools in some of the options it
 provides, which allow probing of particular application behaviours.

 sfnettest is available from www.openonload.org.

 This release is only supported on Linux.  We hope to port more of our
 tools into this framework over time.


Building
========

 cd sfnettest-ver/src
 make


 See README.<appname> for instructions on running each tool.
