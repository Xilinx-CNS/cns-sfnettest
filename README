SfNetTest
=========

 sfnettest is a suite of network performance measuring tools developed by
 Solarflare.  It differs from existing tools in some of the options it
 provides, which allow probing of particular application behaviours.

 This first release is only supported on Linux, and only includes one tool;
 ntpingpong.  We hope port more of our tools into this framework over time.


Building
========

 cd sfnettest-ver/src
 make


 See README.<appname> for instructions on running each tool.
