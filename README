SfNetTest
=========

 sfnettest is a suite of tools for measuring network performance developed
 by Solarflare.  It differs from existing tools in some of the options it
 provides, which allow probing of particular application behaviours.

 This first release is only supported on Linux, and only includes one tool;
 sfnt-pingpong.  We hope port more of our tools into this framework over
 time.


Building
========

 cd sfnettest-ver/src
 make


 See README.<appname> for instructions on running each tool.
